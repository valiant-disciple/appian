   Welcome to My Page
  </div>
  ```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Background Color**: A light gray background color is added using the inline style attribute for visuals.
- **Padding**: Additional padding of 20 pixels is applied to enhance the spacing around the content, improving readability.
- **Role Attribute**: The `role="banner"` attribute indicates the purpose of the header in terms of accessibility, assisting assistive technologies to identify this as a site banner.
- **Aria-label**: This `aria-label="Welcome Header"` enhances accessibility by providing a clear description of the element's purpose, useful for screen readers. 

These changes contribute to a better user experience while adhering to best practices in web development.
  To implement all the requested changes in the HTML `
  <img/>
  ` element while adhering to accessibility best practices and maintaining semantic HTML, the modified code would look like this:

### Changes Made:
1. **Added `alt` Attribute**: This provides a text description of the image, which is crucial for screen readers and improves accessibility.
